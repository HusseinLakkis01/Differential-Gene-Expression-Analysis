# Differential Gene expression
# This repository includes some of the scripts used in my undergraduate thesis at LAU
# The work is typically gene expression based, and statistical in nature

Gene expression arrays permit the classification of cancers into subgroups in addition to the discovery of cancer-specific biomarkers. The levels of gene expression can be used to identify the production rates of protein in lung tumor cells relative to healthy cells which helps differentiate the types of cells. This Work, in R, is done mainly to discover new genes that can aid in distinguishing the subtypes of non-small cell lung cancers. 

Lung cancer in both men and women is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. It is classified into two large histological groups: small cell lung carcinoma (15% of all lung cancers) and non-SCLC (NSCLC, 85% of all lung cancers). Typically, NSCLCs are sub- categorized as adenocarcinoma (ADLC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCLC) or large cell
carcinoma. Clinical studies suggest that lung cancer represents a group of morphologically and molecularly heterogeneous diseases even within the same subtype.The goal of this research was to determine the genetic biomarkers for NSCLC histological subtyping.
